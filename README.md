# Billy-the-Bear

This repository contains both the arduino code and the accompanying sound files to run the animatronic Billy the Bear. Billy plays tic tac toe and educates his audience about bears in a fun and engaging manner. I was part of the project team responsible for creating Billy the Bear, working primarily on the electronics and programming.
